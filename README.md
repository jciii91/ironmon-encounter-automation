# ironmon-encounter-automation
Automate encounter searching for IronMon players. Enter the name and level of the desired encounter and press the start button. The extension will trigger encounters until one matching the search criteria has begun.

Current iteration of this extension is very limited, for now it is simply proof of concept.

When active, a (poorly drawn) crosshair will appear in the bottom left corner of the ROUTE_INFO pane of the InfoScreen. (Pane that shows what mons have been seen in the current area). Clicking this crosshair will bring you to the extension screen. Click the prompt text, enter the name of the mon in all caps and the level you want to find. 

Save the info, situate your character where it can trigger encounters, and hit the Play button. The game will progress until you find your mon. If you wish to stop the search, reopen the extension screen using the same steps and hit the Stop button. (The Play buttons transforms into the Stop button.)
